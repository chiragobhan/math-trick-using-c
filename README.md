# Math Trick Using C Programming
C program asking you to think of 3 consecutive numbers and with some numeric input it will predict the values.  
Let's understand the program with an example.  
  
Step 1: Consider our consecutive nos. to be 1,2,3 and our multiple of 3 is 3.  
  
Step 2: By adding these numbers, we get: 9 (1+2+3+3) and multiplying it by 67 will give us: 603.  
  
Step 3: Enter 0 and 3 in the program respectively, when asked. The program will give the result along with our consecutive numbers.
